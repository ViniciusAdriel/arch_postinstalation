# arch_postinstalation
a script to make my life easier when I reinstall Arch Linux (again)

1. Use archinstall
3. run `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ViniciusAdriel/arch_postinstalation/refs/heads/main/setup.sh | sh`
  
This script is for **my personal use case**:
* KDE Plasma  
* Flatpak supremacy 🙏
  
And I think that's the only relevant point...
